What problem do you want to solve?
I want to make an app that holds odds data for all major events including sports/entertainment/(superbowl, masters, world series, nba finals, presidential elections, oscars etc.) Even further) People can submit random questions that they want people to vote or weight in on. 
How does your app solve this problem?
The app solves the problem of having to use multiple sources.  This will be a one stop shop for all things Odds.
